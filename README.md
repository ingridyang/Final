# Light Show
A light sensor that will react to sound, but each LED light will react to a different frequency of the sound.

## Summary
I built a sound sensor that will be reacted by LED lights. By making this happen, I used a mic sensor that will detect a sound, and each LED light connected is coded with a certain frequency minimum that will light up depending where the sound frequency is between the range of the LED light. Any sound works for the sensor, so the audience can interact with the sensor to see how loud/close they need to be for the mic sensor. Depending on the loudness the light will correlate with it; for example, if you are far or the sound is soft, the light will be dim, but when you are close to the mic or the sound is loud, the light will be bright. 

## Component Parts
I will be using an arduino uno, breadboard, mic sensor, LED lights, 
Mic sensor:
- VCC to 3.3V
- GND to GND
- AUD to A0

LED Lights:
- led1: + to 10, - to GND
- led2: + to 7, - to GND
- led3: + to 12, - to GND

## Timeline
- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1: Find materials/ figure out code
- Week 2: Put together code and materials
- Week 3: Refine
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges
Figuring out what maximum and mimunum to put for each LED light because if it was 10 units higher or lower it messes up the algorithm of the light reacting to sound. Also designing the project to be more complex than it sounds.
