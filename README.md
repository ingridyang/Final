# Battle of the Loudest

A light sensor that will react to sound, but each LED light will react to a different frequency of the sound.

## Summary
I built a sound sensor that will be reacted by LED lights. By making this happen, I used a mic sensor that will detect a sound and each LED light connected is coded with a certain frequency minimum that will light up depending where the sound frequency is between the range of the LED light. Any sound works for the sensor, so the audience can interact with the sensor to see how loud/close they need to be for the mic sensor.

A paragraph or two describing what you are building for your final project.

Include a discussion of how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

## Component Parts

I will be using an arduino uno, breadboard, mic sensor, four LED lights

Describe the components, or pieces, that make up your project.

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## Timeline
- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1: Find materials/ figure out code
- Week 2: Put together code and materials
- Week 3: Refine
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges
Figuring out what maximum and mimunum to put for each LED light because if it was 10 units higher or lower it messes up the algorithm of the light reacting to sound. Also designing the project to be more complex than it sounds.

## Completed Work

Upload photos and videos of your completed final project!

Also upload the code that makes up your project to your repository.
