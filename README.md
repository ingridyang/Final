# Battle of the Loudest

A light sensor that will react to sound, but each LED light will react to a different frequency of the sound.

## Summary
I built a sound sensor that will be reacted by LED lights. By making this happen, I used a mic sensor that will detect a sound and each LED light connected is coded with a certain frequency minimum that will light up depending where the sound frequency is between the range of the LED light. Any sound works for the sensor, so the audience can interact with the sensor to see how loud/close they need to be for the mic sensor.

A paragraph or two describing what you are building for your final project.

Include a discussion of how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

## Component Parts

I will be using an arduino uno, breadboard, mic sensor, four LED lights

Describe the components, or pieces, that make up your project.

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:
